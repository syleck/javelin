Javelin. Probably a monolithic kernel.

Requires: nasm, gcc (i686-elf), binuitls (i686-elf)

How to use a_options.txt and c_options.txt:

They work as shell options. a_options is passed to all i686-elf-ar compiled code, c_options is passed to all i686-elf-gcc compiled code (for KernelMakefile).

For example:

c_options.txt:

    -DPANIC_ON_OOPS -DONT_DO_MODULES

compiles the system to panic on oops, and dont use the modules system
